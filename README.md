## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML,Css, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Java,Spring Boot, Rest Apis, SQL Microservices
- **Microservices Architecture**: Config Server, Eureka Server, API Gateway, Admin Server
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Cloud**: AWS for infrastructure management
- **Version Control**: GitHub
- **Testing**: JUnit for unit testing
- **API Documentation & Testing**: Swagger, Postman

## Key Features
- Citizens can apply for health and insurance plans online.
- The system determines eligibility based on user-provided data.
- Approved citizens are provided with monthly benefits based on their selected plans.

## Government Schemes Covered
- **SNAP**: A food assistance program for low-income individuals.

## API Development
- **RESTful APIs**: A comprehensive set of RESTful APIs were developed to manage user authentication, profile management, application submissions, eligibility determination, and more.
- **Swagger**: Used for API documentation, providing an interactive interface for testing APIs.
- **Postman**: Extensively used to test API endpoints, validate responses, and simulate client-server interactions.
