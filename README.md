## Microservices Architecture
1. **Config Server**: Centralized configuration management for microservices.
2. **Eureka Server**: Service registry for discovering and registering microservices.

   ![Eureka server](https://github.com/boiniraj/Insurance-System-Backend/blob/main/ISH-IMAGES/Eureka-Server.png)
   
5. **API Gateway**: Manages routing for microservices, providing a unified entry point for clients.
7. **Admin Server**: Monitors and manages the various microservices, including health checks and application status.

   ![Admin server](https://github.com/boiniraj/Insurance-System-Backend/blob/main/ISH-IMAGES/admin-server.png)

## API Development
- **RESTful APIs**: A comprehensive set of RESTful APIs were developed to manage user authentication, profile management, application submissions, eligibility determination, and more.
- **Swagger**: Used for API documentation, providing an interactive interface for testing APIs.
- **Postman**: Extensively used to test API endpoints, validate responses, and simulate client-server interactions.
